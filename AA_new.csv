,Confirm that uploading of a resource bundle has not been negatively impacted,,,Uploading,write,,,&quot;On dev &amp; staging, before a new release goes to production, PINT or another individual who has access to uploading content should upload a resource bundle to the environment.

The bundle should include a representative sample of metadata and tagging to closely mimic a typical upload for that customer.  

After uploading, confirm the content is visible on the portal.

Upon deployment to production, conduct the test again.&quot;,,,,,
YL,Confirm uploading localized bundles is working as expected. Upload content in multiple languages - single upload pkg for each bundle,,,Uploading,write,,,&quot;For every language a customer supports, ensure that uploading content does not overwrite other languages. For example, Avaya had an issue occur wherein uploading in one language overwrites another language. https://zoomin-software.atlassian.net/browse/ST-12716

To test this, upload content in the different language codes, one at a time, and confirm the previous languages are still functioning properly on the site.&quot;,,,,,
